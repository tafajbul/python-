## Identity Operators
# a = [10]
# b = [10]
# # a = b
# print(id(a))
# print(id(b))
# print(a is b)

## Membership Operators
# a = [34,56,78]
# print(34 in a)
# print(34 not in a)

## Bitwise Operators
# a = 10
# b = 3
# print(a&b)
# print(a|b)
# print(a^b)

## Bitshift Operators
a = 10
b = 3
print(a<<b)
print(a>>b)
